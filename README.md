# VK PHP BOT Schedule

That's an tool for users to receive last schedule updates. Was created also for my college. Turns into some trash on message analyze stage, but actually, still able to add functions and edit code. (anyway, have to be refactored)
To normal working require tables (I don't give you it, cause I only show code, giving you no tool) and config.php file in same directory. You can edit config-template.php and then rename that.
